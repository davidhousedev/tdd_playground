# TDD TypeScript Sandbox

This repo sets you up with everything you need to start learning TDD practices
using TypeScript and Jest.

## Requirements

* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## How to Run

All common commands should be made using yarn. See the following examples for
a list of common tasks:

```
yarn          // install local requirements
yarn build    // compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
yarn test     // Runs all tests found in *spec.ts files
yarn clean    // Deletes compiled JavaScript
yarn format   // Formats your code with Prettier
```
